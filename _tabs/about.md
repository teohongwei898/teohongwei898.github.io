Hi, I’m Hong Wei, a Cybersecurity Engineer with a strong foundation in digital forensics, threat hunting, and incident response. Currently on attachment to GovTech Singapore from the Cyber Security Agency of Singapore (CSA), I’m part of the National Cyber Incident Response Centre, where I actively investigate and respond to nation-level threats.

My journey started with a degree in Electrical and Electronic Engineering (EEE) from Nanyang Technological University (NTU), where I first explored the technical world through machine learning. Since then, I’ve transitioned from Esports management to cybersecurity operations, building a career around solving complex cyber challenges, improving detection capabilities, and protecting critical infrastructure.

## Current Role

At GovTech Singapore, I work as a Threat Hunter, leveraging advanced analytics and threat intelligence to proactively identify and neutralize threats targeting public sector systems. Concurrently, as a Cybersecurity Consultant (DFIR) at CSA, I conducted investigations into real-world cyber incidents affecting both government and private entities. My findings directly contributed to strengthening Singapore’s national cybersecurity posture.

## Training & Certifications

I hold 30+ professional certifications across Digital Forensics, Incident Response, Threat Intelligence, and Cloud Security. Highlights include:

- OffSec OSCP+, OSWP, and OSCP
- GIAC GCFA, GCFE, GX-FA, and GX-FE
- Microsoft Certified Security Operations Analyst Associate
- Mandiant Advanced Threat Hunting & IR, APT Labs, and Combined Windows-Linux IR
- 13Cubed Gold Series in Windows, Linux, and Memory Forensics
- HTB Job Role Paths (CDSA, CPTS, CBBH)

I regularly engage in red vs blue simulation labs and adversary emulation exercises, such as APT29, Mustang Panda, and APT10, to stay sharp and up to date.

## Educational Background

This project was a rewarding experience that not only showcased the practical applications of machine learning, but also kindled a deeper passion for cutting-edge technologies within me.

I graduated from NTU with a B.Eng. in Electrical and Electronic Engineering, where I focused on machine learning applications. My final year project applied ML to enhance image quality—similar to algorithms found in smartphone cameras [read here](https://dr.ntu.edu.sg/handle/10356/166940). That project sparked my interest in automation, data analysis, and eventually cybersecurity.

## My Cybersecurity Journey

My journey into cybersecurity has been nothing short of serendipitous. I consider myself extremely fortunate to have stumbled upon a field that resonates with my interests and passions. Currently working as a Cybersecurity Consultant (DFIR) in [Cyber Security Agency of Singapore](https://www.csa.gov.sg/), I get to immerse myself in the world of real world cyber investigations as part of the National Incident Response Team. It is defintely a field that constantly challenges me and allows me to apply my technical skills to solve real-world problems.

## Esports

Before transitioning fully into cybersecurity, I was heavily involved in Esports team management and regional operations. I contributed to well-known teams like:

- Paper Rex – Team Manager
- Gaimin Gladiators – APAC Regional Manager

My work involved team operations, regional expansion, and building vibrant gaming communities — skills that still support my work in stakeholder engagement, cross-functional coordination, and crisis management in cyber operations.

## Teaching & Mentorship

I’m also a Teaching Assistant at the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD), conducting sessions on:

- Web Application Forensics
- Forensics Tooling & Analysis
- Incident Response methodologies

This role allows me to contribute to developing the next generation of cybersecurity professionals under CSA’s Cybersecurity Development Programme (CSDP).
