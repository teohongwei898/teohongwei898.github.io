## OSCP Offensive Security Certified Professional

It seems inevitable that anyone who successfully completes this examination will share their thoughts, regardless of whether it's a message or a video detailing the painstaking preparation process.

Full Disclosure: I'm just another Electrical and Electronics Engineering Graduate with limited computing experience, but I attained the CEH (Certified Ethical Hacker) Master before undertaking this course and examination.

1. Before embarking on the OSCP journey, it's crucial to understand your personal motivation. Ask yourself why you want to take this exam. Is it for job advancement, opening up more career opportunities, or acquiring knowledge? Having a clear personal reason will help maintain motivation, especially during challenging times. Passion becomes your driving force when the initial excitement fades away. As for me, well it's due to [REDACTED].

2. The OSCP heavily relies on Linux environments. Getting comfortable with Linux is essential. Familiarize yourself with basic commands, file systems, and navigation. Develop the skills to efficiently work within a Linux terminal, as it is a fundamental aspect of the exam.

3. Take detailed notes for all modules and machines. Document your thought process, commands used, successful exploits, and lessons learned. These notes become invaluable during the exam and help reinforce your understanding. Create a systematic approach to organize your notes, making it easier to review and refer back to specific information.

4. Avoid spending too much time on a single machine. If you encounter difficulties, it's often more productive to move on to another machine and revisit the challenging one later. Effective time management is crucial during the exam, and learning to allocate time wisely on each machine contributes to success.

5. The OSCP exam is designed to be challenging. Embrace a "Try Harder" mentality, a mantra often associated with the course. Persistence is key. When faced with obstacles or setbacks, approach them with a determined mindset. Keep trying different approaches until you find a solution.
