Note: As with any certifications, NDA/policy dictates that questions or answers cannot be discussed here. The purpose of this post is simply to share experiences.

This post is long overdue, but it is what it is. I passed the CISSP with **125 questions in just an hour** or so. Looking back, it was very insane and risky, but personally, I feel that the more I mull over a question, the more likely I am to get it wrong. I've come across advice that suggests not overthinking; if you are confident with the answer, just go with your gut feeling. I guess it worked out, and I'm happy to know that it did.

## CISSP Certified Information Systems Security Professional

In contrast to many, I opted not to use the official LearnZapp application, and my overall readiness score amusingly stood at 47% 😅. In my approach, I firmly believe that questions serve solely to reinforce concepts, and 'spamming' various question banks isn't a necessity; relying on the Official Study Guide (OSG) and Official Practice Tests (OPT) sufficed for me.

Over a span of three months, I committed an hour or two after work to the Master Class Course (huge shoutout to Rob!). Upon completing each domain, I found it beneficial to revisit the Question Bank specific to that domain to solidify my understanding. As the exam date approached, I gathered community questions from diverse sources and engaged in small practice tests, pinpointing domains where I needed improvement.

To address weaker domains, I turned to Destination Certification videos for a comprehensive review. It is worth noting that I have a habit, carried over from university, of taking notes on pen and paper rather than the computer. This tactile approach helps me understand and internalize concepts more effectively. Learning styles vary, so it's crucial not to blindly follow any one method.

On the nights leading up to the exam, I made sure to prioritize rest. Always good to keep a fresh mind for the actual exam. •⩊•

## Exam Strategy

My only advice is to follow a systematic approach for each and EVERY question:

1. Concentration: Concentrate solely on the question at hand, and block out any uncertainties from previous attempted questions.
2. Triple Reading: Read the question a minimum of three times to ensure a thorough understanding of its nuances and requirements.
3. Keyword Identification: Identify and highlight keywords within the question.
4. Mental Resilience: This exam DESTROYS you mentally. You will feel like you are failing throughout the whole examination. It is EXTREMELY important to keep a positive mindset.
5. Priority Order: Adhere to the priority order of Policy/People > Process > Technology. This hierarchy helps in picking your answer by addressing policy/people considerations first, followed by processes, and technology.

## Closing

Best of luck to anyone who is taking the exam in the future! Have lots of fun! ( • ̀ω•́ )✧
