Note: As with any certifications, NDA/policy dictates that questions or answers cannot be discussed here. The purpose of this post is simply to share experiences.

This post is long overdue, but it is what it is. I passed the CISSP with 125 questions in just an hour or so. Looking back, it was very insane and risky, but personally, I feel that the more I mull over a question, the more likely I am to get it wrong. I've come across advice that suggests not overthinking; if you are confident with the answer, just go with your gut feeling. I guess it worked out, and I'm happy to know that it did.

## CISSP Certified Information Systems Security Professional

Contrary to many, I did not use the official LearnZapp application. In my case, I firmly believe, from shared experiences with colleagues and the cyber community, that questions are there to reinforce concepts. I don't see the need to 'spam' various question banks; just the OSG/OPT will suffice.

Over a period of 2-3 months, I dedicated an hour or two after work to the Master Class course. On weekends, I occasionally visited the library for focused study sessions. After every domain, I did practice quizzes. My overall readiness score was 47%. In the week leading up to the exam, I took small practice tests on LearnZapp to identify the domains I was weak in and then reviewed those concepts using Destination Certification videos. On the nights before the exam, I reviewed the DestCert mind map videos.

Another caveat is that I don't take notes on the computer. It's a habit from university; taking notes on pen and paper allows me to understand and ingrain the concepts more clearly. Different people have different styles of learning, so don't follow blindly.

## Exam Strategy

TBC

Concentrate on the question at hand, and don't let any doubt from previous questions linger.
For every question:
Read the question at least three times.
Identify the keywords.
Policy > People > Process > Technology.
