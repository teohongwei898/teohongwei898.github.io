Note: As with any certifications, NDA/policy dictates that questions or answers cannot be discussed here. The purpose of this post is simply to share experiences.

This was one of the two professional certifications sponsored by my employer, which includes a 5 day boot camp. As of writing, there appears to be a syllabus change; however, upon examining the differences, I don't believe they are significant. Therefore, the disparity is not as substantial as some might think.
