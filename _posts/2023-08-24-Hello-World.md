Hello World!

Whoever you are, I hope this post finds you well! ðŸŒŸ

Today, I'm excited to share a little personal project I've been contemplating for a while. Back in my undergraduate days in NTU, I used to host a private site, where I reflected on the modules I took throughout my semesters, diving into the nitty-gritty of them. It wasn't ever published, and that's partially because it wasn't exactly well maintained. ðŸ˜Š

As I embark on this new phase in my life, I have decided to take that concept a step further and migrate my learnings/reflections to a public page. Why, you ask? Honestly, I'm not sure how it will benefit me or anyone else in the World Wide Web, but hey, isn't that the fun of trying something new?

Life is a journey for everyone, and my hope is that by sharing my experiencesâ€”both past and present, I can connect with others who might be on similar paths/situation. Maybe you are a fellow human like me trying to navigate the complexities of a new career, or perhaps you are someone who just enjoys a good story about someone in the world. Either way, throughout my life (thus far), I believe there is a value in shared experiences, and who knows, maybe we can all learn a little something from each other.

So, cheers to stepping out of my comfort zone, and to the possibility of creating a little corner of the internet where stories are shared, connections are made, and maybe, some good vibes are spread.

Last but not least, I won't have any roadmap for this, and that's okay. (at least for me)

Sometimes the most rewarding journeys are the unplanned ones.
