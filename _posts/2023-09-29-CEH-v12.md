Note: As with any certifications, NDA/policy dictates that questions or answers cannot be discussed here. The purpose of this post is simply to share experiences.

Wrapped up the CEH Practical on a regular Saturday in August, and followed it up with the theory in late September as part of the training given by my employer! (Part 2)

While it is uncertain how directly applicable this write-up may be due to the periodic revisions in EC-Council's CEH syllabus, I figured I might as well share my insights for the benefit of those navigating the CEH.
